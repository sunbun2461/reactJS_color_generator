// React.js
// ---------------
  
  
  
//   React is modular. Instead of writing large,dense files of code, you can write many smaller, reusable files. React's modularity can be a beautiful solution to JavaScripts maintainability problems. 

//   React is scalable. Large programs that display a lot of changing data are where React performs best. 
//   React is flexible. You can use React for interesting projects that have nothign to do with making a web app. People are still figuring out Reacts potential. Theres room to explore. 
  
//   React is popular. While this reason has admittedly little to do with Reacts quality, the trush is that understanding React will make you more employable. 
  
  

  
 
  
//  Intro to JSX

// Hello World

// Take a look at the following line of code:
      
    const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;


What kind of weird hybrid code is that? Is it JavaScript? HTML? Or something else?
  
  It seems like it must be JavaScript, since it starts with const and ends with ;. If you tried to run that in an HTML file, it wouldnt work. 

  However, the code also contains <h1>Hello world</h1>, which looks exactly like HTML. That part wouldnt work if you tried to run it in a JavaScript file. 

  Whats going on?
  
  The Mystery, Revealed

  Good! Take another look at the line of code that you wrote. Does this code belong in a JavaScript file, an HTML file, or somewhere else?
  The answer is...a JavaScript file! Despite what is looks like, your code doesnt actually contain any HTML at all. 
  That part that looks like HTML, <h1>Hello world</h1>, is something called JSX
